# OnlyFans Profile Downloader/Archiver
This tool downloads all photos/videos from an OnlyFans profile, creating a local archive.
You must be subscribed to the profile to download their content.

onlyfans-dl will create a directory called `profiles` in the repo directory. 
Each profile you download will be stored as a subdirectory of `profiles`.
Inside each profile directory, some information will be saved in `info.json`,
and all media will be downloaded to `photos/` and `videos/`.

LOOK: `python -m pip install requests`

## Usage
`./onlyfans-dl.py <profile>`
* `<profile>` - the username of the profile to download

## Access Token
OnlyFans does a bunch of captcha schit in the login, so I wasn't able to automate the login
process. It's very easy to get your auth token though, here's how:

- Open your browser.

- After checking the value of your User-Agent (you can do this [here](https://whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent)),
copy it, and put it in the value of the `User-Agent` key of `API_HEADER` in `config.json`.
- Login to OnlyFans as normal.
- Once you have logged in, open the Storage Inspector (`SHIFT+F9` on FireFox). This will be under
the "Application" tab of Chrome DevTools.
- Click Cookies -> https://onlyfans.com
- Copy the value of the `sess` cookie, that's your access token.
- put this in the value of the `ACCESS_TOKEN` key in `config.json`

Once you have your access token, don't logout or otherwise end your session until you have
finished downloading content with onlyfans-dl.

## Updates
You need to untrack your config file first:
`git rm --cached config.json`
You can then do a pull for updates
`git pull`

## Contributing

PRs are welcome; be sure to take some time to familiarize yourself with OnlyFans' API if
you would like to extend/modify the functionality of this script.
